#### Problem Statement

To match music files using machine learning.

#### Detailed Description

The folder **Tracks** contains music tracks `Track01.mp3` to `Track_09.mp3`The distorted versions of the Track are in files named `Trac01d.mp3` to `Trac09d.mp3` You need to create a system which can output the matching score of each distorted file with the original recordings.

###Project Flow

#Importing Libraries

#Chromagram Generation Function

#Generating Note Frequency of the Chromagram

#Plotting Heat Map and Note Frequency Plot

#Pre-Processing Data and generating Chromagram and then plotting Heatmap

#Getting the Dataset containg Values of the note frequency

#Then doing K-NNN clustering and training centroids with epochs as 2000

#Then final output as final labels and clustering labels
